# IRIS-Dataset-Using-Supervised-Learning-Algorithms
Problem Description
Use sklearn.datasets iris flower dataset to train your model using logistic regression. You need
to figure out the accuracy of your model and use that to predict different samples in your test
dataset. In iris dataset there are 150 samples containing following features,
1. Sepal Length
2. Sepal Width
3. Petal length
4. Petal width
Using above 4 features you will classify a flower in one of the three categories,
1. Setosa
2. Versicolour
3. Virginica
   1.Datapreprocessing
           Find the stats,to display basic datatype,target values etc
   2.Exploratory Analysis
             To display the chart using the histplot for Sepal Length, Sepal Width,Petal length, Petal width
              Use The correlation matrix for the dataset.
   3.Split the Dataset
              Split the dataset into train and test data for the data columns and target values
   4.Hyperparameter tuning
               Grid Search Cross-Validation, is a technique used in machine learning for hyperparameter tuning. It's a systematic way to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a machine learning model.
         Here,by using the iris dataset the supervised learning algorithms applied to find the accuracy score .Logistic Regression,Decision Tree,Random forest,KNeighbors,Svc,Naive Bayes.Here the Naive Bayes Accuracy score is 98.79% Setosa-50,Versicolor-47,Vercina-46. It is the best model from the overall observation.
   5.Confussion Matrix
                For each and every model confussion matrix is applied for the clear observation










    
     By using this dataset applied the supervised learnig algorithms such as Logistic Regression,Decison Tree,Random Forest,SVC,KNeighbors,Naive Bayes algorithms...
